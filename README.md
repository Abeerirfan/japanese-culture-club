# Welcome to the Japanese Culture Club repo!
This is a repo to collect all materials and resources related to Ada's Japanese Culture Club (JCC). You are invited to fork this repo and use our materials-- please let us know what you do with them and how it goes!

## What is the Japanese Culture Club (JCC)?
We bring people together via the similar interests in Japanese culture, by encouraging them to embrace diversity whilst simultaneously hoping to quench their curiosity about Japan.
We will learn Japanese etiquette and language whilst also generating an understanding of their culture.
We are an educational club as well as providing a medium that promotes socialisation.

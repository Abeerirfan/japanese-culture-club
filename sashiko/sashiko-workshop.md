# Sashiko Workshop 
> Sashiko (刺し子, literally "little stabs" or "little pierce") is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching (or functional embroidery) from Japan that started out of practical need during the Edo era (1615-1868). Traditionally used to reinforce points of wear or to repair worn places or tears with patches, making the darned piece ultimately stronger and warmer,this running stitch technique is often used for purely decorative purposes in quilting and embroidery. The white cotton thread  the traditional indigo blue cloth (said to recall snow falling around old farmhouses[1]) givones sashiko its distinctive appearance, though decorative items sometimes use red thread.

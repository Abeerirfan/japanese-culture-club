# Pokemon Terrarium

There is an online craft trend to build pokeball terrariums, that show what the inside environments of pokeballs look like. This craze was started by Texas based artist [The Vintage Realm](https://twitter.com/TheVintageRealm) who has been so overwhelmed with interest on Etsy she's had to stop taking orders.
